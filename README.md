## A homework project from Semos

The original project was supposed to allow you to enter user details in a form and to have what you type be coppied to adjacent `div` elements.

I edited the following, to make the homework more difficult:

 - Converted everything to Functional Components
 - Implemented State
 - Every registered user via the form gets displayed in a table
 - You can load three sample users by clicking on a button
 - Implemented Material-UI to manage CSS

### Run `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
